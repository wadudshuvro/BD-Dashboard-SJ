## Before You Edit

### Do:
- Use clear, descriptive file names in UPPERCASE-WITH-DASHES.md format
- Include a "Last Updated" section with date and summary of changes
- Link to related docs using relative paths
- Use the standard template below
- Keep files focused (one feature = one file)
- Add your doc to the appropriate category folder

### Don't:
- Leave files at project root (except README.md, CLAUDE.md)
- Use vague file names (notes.md, todo.md, info.md)
- Create nested folders beyond 2 levels (docs/01-architecture/subfolder/ max)
- Mix unrelated topics in one file
- Duplicate information across multiple files

---

## For AI Assistants

When working on this codebase:

1. **Read this guide first** to understand documentation structure
2. **Check existing docs** before creating new ones
3. **Follow the template** for consistency
4. **Update existing docs** rather than creating duplicates
5. **Archive outdated docs** instead of deleting them
6. **Use relative links** between documentation files

---

## Archived Documentation

The `archive/` folder contains historical documentation that may still be useful for reference:

- **bug-fixes/** - Historical bug fix documentation and troubleshooting
- **deployment-logs/** - Past deployment records and release notes
- **session-notes/** - Development session summaries
- **misc/** - Migration guides and other archived content

These files are preserved for historical reference but should not be used as current guidance.
